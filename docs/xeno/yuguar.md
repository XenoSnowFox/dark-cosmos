# Yuguar

**Approx. Height:** 8ft or 250cm

A large heavily furred species, similar in appearance to a polar bear, more adapted to the snow and cold of their originating planet. Although a Yuguar's fur may appear white, it is actually transparent, evolved over time to trap and maintain heat from the light of the nearest star or heat source. Yuguar's must consume large quantities of food, to help maintain the energy required to move their large forms and survive temperatures colder than what other Xeno species (inc. Humans) could naturally endure.
