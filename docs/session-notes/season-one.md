# Season One: Lost & Found

## Season Preparation

### Opening Scene

We'll be starting off our first session mid-job. Leading up to the job, you got word that there is significant financial interest (from the right buyer) for a mysterious LockBox that is currently being stored within [The Concordant Archives](/planets/concordant-archives). Your crew undertook sufficient preparation for this job. You obtained the location of the vault holding the LockBox and access passes for some (or either all) of your crew. The plan was to sneak in, acquire the LockBox and hold onto it until the heat from this job has subsided.

The session will begin with either some or all of you (and your crew) at the vault with the LockBox in hand. Questions you will need to consider prior to our first session are:

- Is you character inside the Archives? Are you at the Vault with the LockBox?
- If you are not within the Archives, where are you and what were you doing?
- What is your plan to escape? There is a Hyperlane Gate nearby that can take you to the [Kep System](/star-system/kep).

#### Information To Note

- The Concordant Archives is located within the [Pangatis System](/star-system/pangatis).
- We will begin the session with an Engagement roll, to determine the position you will be in with the action starts. (ie are you in control, is it risky or are you in a desperate situation).
