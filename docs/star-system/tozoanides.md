# About Tozoanides

Tozoanides the most well-known lost star system of the [Erilia Sector](/secotr/erilia), its people were cut of from the sector when the way-field of the connecting hyperlane collapsed. Without access to the hyperlane, it is estimated that it would take several thousands years (at best) for a standard freighter ship to travel between Tozoanides and the Bechill Quadrant.
