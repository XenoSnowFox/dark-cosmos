The Concordant Archives are a series of large interconnected facilities built upon a rouge asteroid. The added mass of the buildings locked the asteroid into an orbit around the system's main sun. The facilities are designed to store various items, such as Ur Artifacts, Legal/Doctrine Scrolls, Research notes and abandoned experiments.
