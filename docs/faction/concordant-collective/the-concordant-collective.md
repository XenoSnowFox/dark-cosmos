# The Concordant Collective

**Tier Rating:** ++"IV"++<br />
**Starting Status:** ++"0"++

The Concordant Collective is the representative government of this galaxy. Although planets generally govern independently, those majority who form part of the collective are held to it's laws and powers (think of this operating like the USA, there's an overall federal government and then there are independent state governments).

Overseeing this government is a figure known as The Concorde. The Concorde rules from their seat amidst the government chambers near the center of the galaxy. The Concorde's greatest task is keeping power divided between factions such that they always squabble over it, and don't unify to seat a new Concorde.

The galaxy itself is carved into sectors, put under the stewardship of several Noble Houses. Technology and Science are the domain of Collective Approved Guilds (such as the Guild of Engineering). Mysteries and the arcane fall to Collective Approved Cults (such as the Church of the Stellar Flame). Each of these guard their domains jealously.

## Turf / Residence

The Concorde and the Concordant Council reside on the planet of [Citadel](/planet/citadel) within the [Bechil Quadrant](/star-system/bechil-quadrant). Their influence spreads to the majority of planets within the [Erilia Sector](/sector/erilia).
