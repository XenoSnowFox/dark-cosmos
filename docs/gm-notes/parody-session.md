# Dark Cosmos: The Sparkle Scourge (Parody Session Plan)

**Game System:** *Scum & Villainy* (Forge in the Dark Role-Playing Game)
**Estimated Runtime:** 3 Hours
**Player Characters:** Algenon "Kentucky Blue" (Stitch), Ark "Rook" Ferris (Mystic), V Borong "Demon" (Pilot).
**Antagonist:** **Discordant** (Based on Discord from *My Little Pony*), the chaotic leader of the Concordant.
**Goal:** Infiltrate the Discordant’s new Citadel, disable the universal destruction device, and escape before the universe is turned into glitter.

## Setup & Engagement (30 Minutes)

### Introduction and Setting the Scene

The crew of the *Koifish* (Corvette class ship) has recently regrouped, likely having just escaped the Solaris system after the explosion of the CCF Osprey. V is visibly back on the bridge, but his recent trauma is evident in his hyper-paranoia.

**Location:** A hastily established hidden asteroid base (dingy, fluorescent lights, shuffling papers—similar to the Concordant Archives) in a system bordering the core Concordant worlds.

**The Mission Brief:**
The crew is meeting with a panicked resistance contact: **Princess Twilight Sparkle**, a small, purple-furred Caxle (koala bear person).

*   **Twilight’s Story:** The Caxle, disguised as a sanitation worker, was infiltrating the Discordant’s floating headquarters—the **Citadel of Chaos**. She discovered that the Concordant Leader, **Discordant**, has obtained a Precursor Artifact (a shimmering obsidian cube wrapped in pink plastic) called the **Harmonic Reset Device**.
*   **The Threat:** Discordant intends to activate the device, thereby destroying the universe by "harmonizing" it—i.e., turning all matter into glitter and forcing eternal, synchronized show tunes [111, Parody Element].
*   **The Timeline:** Twilight accidentally triggered the countdown by spilling her anxiety-fueled tea on the main console. The device will activate in **3 hours** (real-time session limit).
*   **The Target:** The Citadel of Chaos. It orbits Planet Equestria Prime, a swirling gas giant that is unnaturally colored in pastel rainbows. The Citadel itself is a dizzying, impossibly structured station defined by chaos magic and candy-colored architecture.

### Character Actions

1.  **Parody Recap:** Encourage the players to provide a (bad, possibly conflicting) recap of V's kidnapping and return, Ark's masterful explosions, and Kentucky’s artifact obsession. V insists he was never gone, citing his Paranoid Trauma.
2.  **Loadouts:** PCs select their Load Level.
    *   **V:** Selects **Light Load** (3 slots), arguing stealth is key, despite wearing a ridiculous feathered trench coat. (Player may note the irony of his previous failure to sneak).
    *   **Ark:** Selects **Heavy Load** (6 slots), reasoning he needs all his explosive and protective gear, ready for maximum chaos.
    *   **Kentucky:** Selects **Normal Load** (5 slots), prioritizing his diagnostic tools and Medkit/Syringes.
3.  **Engagement Roll:** Roll 1d6 (or 2d6 for advantage if they use a Gambits or push themselves) to determine the starting position. Aim for a Controlled or Risky start to get straight into the action.

## Phase 2: Infiltration of the Citadel (90 Minutes)

The crew’s primary objective is to reach Discordant’s Throne Room and neutralize the artifact. **Start an 8-Segment Clock: "Disable Harmonic Reset Device."**

### Scene 1: V's Risky Maneuver

V must pilot the *Koifish* through the Citadel’s orbital defense grid, which consists of synchronized security drones that leave perfectly symmetrical gaps.

*   **V Action:** **Helm** roll (Risky/Standard). V must demonstrate "speed or flare".
*   *Consequence:* V succeeds but the **Harmony Knights** (the Concordant Military, now clad in pastel armor) [4, Parody Element] notice the *Koifish* due to V’s flashy—but effective—maneuver. The *Koifish* is docked, but Ark and Kentucky must move fast.

### Scene 2: The Shifting Corridors (Chaos Magic)

The initial hallways are shifting and twisting, decorated in swirling, clashing color schemes that defy physics.

*   **Challenge:** The PCs need to find the correct path before a Harmony Knight patrol intercepts them.
*   **Kentucky Action:** Kentucky attempts a **Study** roll (Insight) to discern the Precursor Artifact’s chaotic energy patterns, attempting to predict the corridors' shifts.
    *   *If Successful:* Kentucky finds the shortest path, leading them to the next objective and advancing the clock by 2 segments.
    *   *If Mixed/Failed:* They are cornered by two Harmony Knights.
*   **Ark Action (if cornered):** Ark uses **Attune** (Wisdom/The Way) to stabilize the physical manifestation of the corridor just long enough for them to squeeze past the Knights, suffering stress but advancing the clock by 1 segment.

### Scene 3: The Harmony Knights Patrol

The PCs encounter a trio of rigidly polite, yet armed, Harmony Knights blocking a massive, unnecessary golden doorway. The Knights demand their "Permission Slips for Joyful Passage."

*   **Challenge:** Bypass or neutralize the patrol without raising a general alert.
*   **V Action:** V uses **Sway** to convince the Knights he is a Concordant Auditor sent to check their "Sparkle Compliance," relying on his past military background and sheer arrogance.
*   *V’s Devil’s Bargain Option:* Mav (V’s cousin/mentor from his past) appears briefly on a fuzzy security monitor, looking disappointed. V gains a die but must take 2 extra stress.
*   **Success:** V successfully fools the Knights, who immediately begin arguing among themselves about the proper "Sparkle Standard." Clock advances by 2 segments.

### Scene 4: The Glitter Trap and Ark's Counter-Chaos

They find Princess Twilight Sparkle (Caxle) trapped in a security cell—a small enclosure where everything is covered in sticky, rainbow glitter. She is unharmed but weeping about the universal show tunes.

*   **Challenge:** Free Twilight and continue to the Throne Room.
*   **Ark Action:** Ark uses **Hack** or **Rig** to disable the security field. Ark can choose to use his chaotic experience to jerry-rig a counter-chaos device (a small bundle of stolen cables and plastic unicorn toys) to blow the door open.
    *   *Desperate Roll XP:* If Ark makes this a Desperate roll (maxing his stress), he earns XP for the action.
*   **Result:** Twilight is free! She agrees to help by identifying the nearest *unstable* component of the Harmonic Reset Device (based on her accidental prior tea-spillage). Clock advances by 2 segments. (Clock should now be at 7/8 segments).

## Phase 3: Climax and Escape (45 Minutes)

### Scene 5: The Throne Room Showdown

The crew bursts into the Throne Room. Discordant is hovering beside the Harmonic Reset Device, which is actively emitting unstable, rainbow energy. Discordant, a massive, multicolored figure of pure dissonance, is dressed in the robes of the Concordant leader.

*   **Discordant:** "Well, well, well! If it isn't the little space pests! You're just in time for the grand finale—a universe bathed in shimmering, glorious non-existence!"
*   **Chaos Escalates:** Discordant’s mere presence causes Ark’s fur to turn neon pink and Kentucky’s medical tools to morph into squeaky dog toys (parodying the debilitating effects of The Way/Chaos) [82, Parody].

*   **Final Challenge:** Disable the Harmonic Reset Device (final segment of the clock).

*   **Kentucky Action:** Kentucky must use **Doctor** or **Rig** to quickly apply a dose of stabilizing "xenobiological anti-chaos agent" (likely morphine mixed with poppy seeds and cinnamon) directly into the artifact’s core, treating the precursor tech like a sick patient.
    *   *V/Twilight Assist:* V provides covering fire (*Scrap*), while Twilight points out the console Twilight spilled tea on earlier (Twilight Assist).
    *   *Result:* Kentucky needs a mixed success (4/5) for the device to stop but for Discordant to be alerted. Full success (6) causes the artifact to destabilize Discordant instantly.

### Scene 6: The Chaotic Escape

Discordant is enraged (or temporarily destabilized). The Citadel begins shaking and imploding with uncontrolled chaos magic.

*   **Ark Action:** Ark needs to clear a path out using the Way. Ark uses **Attune** to unleash a massive burst of controlled chaos (Kinetic ability), flinging a piece of the architecture (perhaps a giant, foam unicorn horn) to seal the exit behind them, giving them cover.
    *   *Desperate Roll:* Ark maximizes stress, risking a trauma.

*   **V Action:** They race back to the *Koifish*. V must use a desperate **Helm** roll to blast the ship out of the collapsing Citadel before the explosion of glitter consumes them. V must succeed at a desperate roll to dodge the *explosive cupcake* Discordant throws at the last moment.
    *   *Critical Success (double sixes):* V pulls a "Fast and Furious" drift, scooping up Ark and Kentucky, and achieving maximum cinematic escape.

## Phase 4: Payoff and Experience (15 Minutes)

The *Koifish* jumps away, glitter and show tunes echoing faintly behind them. They saved the universe, but Discordant now knows their names.

1.  **Payoff & Heat:**
    *   **Payoff:** 6 Credits (Saving the Universe is a lucrative business).
    *   **Heat:** The mission was **Completely Wild with Devastating Exposure**. Gained **6 Heat** for massive property damage (exploding Citadel) + **2 Heat** for Spark of Rebellion (the *Koifish* calling card). They are now firmly Wanted Level 1 (8 Heat) in the core sector.

2.  **Entanglements Roll:** Roll 1d6. (Likely "Interrogation" or "Fugitives").

3.  **Experience Questions**:
    *   Did you execute a successful job that opposes the concordant? **(YES)**.
    *   Did you contend with challenges above your current station? **(YES)** (Fighting a universal chaos deity/leader of the Concordant is well above their paygrade).
    *   *Individual XP:* Prompt players to justify XP based on their character's playbook question (Insight/Wisdom/Flare) or if they struggled with their Vice (The Weird/Pleasure) or Trauma (Paranoid).
