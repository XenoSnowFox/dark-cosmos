A large gas planet of the [Solairace](/star-system/solairace) system. The planet is orbited by approximately 500 moons, of which many mining platforms have been constructed to mine the planet's natural resources. It's common practice for these mining stations to be autonomously managed by Urbots.

## Additional Rules

The planet surface does not have a breathable or hospitable environment. Traveling on the planet without protection results in a **level 4 harm**.
