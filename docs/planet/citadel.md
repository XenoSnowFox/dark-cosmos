Citadel is the largest of four moons orbiting [The Burrows](/planet/the-burrows). Each of the other three moons are military outposts tasked with protecting the Concorde and the Concordant Council while they reside on the planet.

## Additional Rules

**Engagement Rolls** on the Citadel are always at ++"\-1d"++ due to the heightened military monitoring. Any jobs run against the Concordant Collective are considered to be on hostile turf.
