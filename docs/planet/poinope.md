Located in the [Caaroid System](/star-system/caaroid), Poinope is the originating planet of the [Kxal](/xeno/kxal) xeno species. The planet's large size and increased gravity makes it hard for everyday persons to travel about, however the Kxal managed to evolve to accomoate.

## The Concordant's Influence
